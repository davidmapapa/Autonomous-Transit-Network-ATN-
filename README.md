# Summary 

 An Autonomous Transit Network can be described as a system of podcars (vehicle) that operate under a common track while each following their individual route. The system is labeled autonomous due to fact that no driving operator stir the cars, but instead a centralize computer manage the flow of traffic depending on each client's destination. In such system, the podcars operate on an ELEVATED guideway, while avoiding traffic, buildings and natural habitats. Such system of pod cars are often referred to as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). 
 
In the project bellow I will describe step by step the required designs and code in order to build a single podcar to run on a track while switching from an inner to an outter station. The switch will either be done through a random function generated by the code or by a webrowser page controlled by thhe user. 

 
  # ATN project
 
 Our project will design a small scale design of an autonomous transportation network, in order to show the functionality, as well as create a basic software platform that is scalable.
