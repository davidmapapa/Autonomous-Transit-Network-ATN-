# Autonomous-Transit-Network-ATN-
In order to accomplish the task, I will walk you through the process of building a podcar by: 
\Teaching you how to solder the circuit board used for the components 
\write the software related to each sensor 
\Write some GET/POST http function to send data to a server 
\Set up a ESP32 camera 
\Connect Raspberry Pi's to each pod in order to talk to the tensor flow software
