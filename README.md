# Summary 

 An Autonomous Transit Network can be described as a system of podcars (vehicle) that operate under a common track while each following their individual route. The system is labeled autonomous because no driving operator stir the cars, but instead a centralize computer manage the flow of traffic depending on each client's destination. In such system, the podcars operate on an ELEVATED guideway avoiding traffic, buildings and natural habitats. Such system of pod cars are often referred to as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). 
 
 In the project bellow I will describe the steps needed to design and program a single pod to run on a track. The pod will switch from the inner to the outter station of the track, through the random function generated by the code or a webrowser page controlled by thhe user. 

Building such pod will require both hardware and software skills, which will be explained in detail in this project.
