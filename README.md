# Autonomous Transit Network  

 An Autonomous Transit Network can be described as a system of podcars that operate under a common track while each following their individual route. The system is considered autonomous due to fact that no driving operator stir the cars, but instead a centralize computer manage the flow of traffic depending of each client destination. 
 
 In such system, the podcars operate on an ELEVATED guideway, while avoiding traffic, buildings and natural habitats. Moreover, unlike other means of transportation such as buses, train, etc. One does not need to stop at each station in order to reach their destination. Instead, a simple click on a button (app, machines, etc) will Sufis to transport the individual to their destination. 
 
 This is done so, by having offline station, by providing some collision avoidance between cars and more importantly having a robust and user friendly system to would be easy to use. 
 
 # ATN project
 
 Our project will design a small scale design of an autonomous transportation network, in order to show the functionality, as well as create a basic software platform that is scalable.
