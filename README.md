# Autonomous-Transit-Network-ATN-
To advance personal rapid transportation whilst offering a safe and robust control system that would allow users to enter a podcar and reach  their destination without having to make every stop. 

The scope of this project will incorporate the necessary information to replicate the small scale designs, prints and code in order to build a showcase model.
