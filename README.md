# Autonomous Transit Network 

1)-Summary 

 An Autonomous Transit Network can be described as a system of podcars (vehicle) that operate under a common track while each following their individual route. The system is labeled autonomous due to fact that no driving operator stir the cars, but instead a centralize computer manage the flow of traffic depending on each client's destination. In such system, the podcars operate on an ELEVATED guideway, while avoiding traffic, buildings and natural habitats. Such system of pod cars are often referred to as Personal Rapid Transit (PRT). 
 
In the project bellow I will desgin a small scale model of one pod car driving around a track while switching from an inner station to an outter station. The switch will be done automatically or on a webrowser page by an user. 

 
  # ATN project
 
 Our project will design a small scale design of an autonomous transportation network, in order to show the functionality, as well as create a basic software platform that is scalable.
